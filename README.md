# SortingAlgoVisualizer
This is a web applications built with d3.js and Angular that visualizes bubble sort, merge sort, counting sort, and quick sort 
on a random array with integers in the interval [1, 300]. The user is able to generate a random array by clicking the generate array 
button. He or she is also able to adjust the size of the array using a slider.
Of note, d3.js was used as a utility tool, specifically the d3.scale and d3.scale-chromatic modules, and did not directly modify the DOM as this would interfere with Angular's optimization.
